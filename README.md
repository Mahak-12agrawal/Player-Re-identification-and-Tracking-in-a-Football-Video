# Player Re-Identification and Tracking in Football Video

This project is an **implementation and adaptation** of an existing open-source project
focused on player detection, tracking, and re-identification in football videos.

The system uses:
- YOLOv8 for object detection
- DeepSORT for multi-object tracking
- OpenCV for video processing

---

## 🔧 My Work
- Set up and executed the complete project locally on Windows
- Installed and configured all required dependencies
- Ran inference on football video successfully
- Generated tracked output video (`output_tracked.mp4`)
- Understood the YOLOv8 + DeepSORT tracking pipeline

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Real-time object detection
- Multi-object tracking and re-identification
- Video processing using OpenCV
- Working with pretrained deep learning models

## ▶️ How to Run This Project (Windows)
-# Step 1: Open terminal in project folder
-cd Player-Re-identification-and-Tracking-in-a-Football-Video

-# Step 2: Install dependencies
-pip install ultralytics opencv-python deep_sort_realtime

-# Step 3: Place required files
- best.pt (YOLO model)
- 15sec_input_720p.mp4 (input video)

-# Step 4: Run the project
-python main.py
